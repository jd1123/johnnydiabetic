Johnnydiabetic.com Django source
====================

This is the Django source for my website. I am making this website for a few reasons, namely to learn more about web programming. 
Currently it consists of a few small django apps.

Wedding Pictures
-----
The main reason to create this. I want to show off my wedding pics to my family but have some sort of authentication so only registered users can see them.
So far, this is working, and I even added a little jQuery.

Forum
----
A forum. No one will want to use it, but I just wanted to see what it would take to build one.

My Blog
----
I've never kept a blog before, and maybe I will in the future. But it seems like a good way to learn web programming. Right now,
it has one post and the interface is not great, but I plan to work on this little by little.

Blood Sugar Monitor
----
I have type-1 diabetes. I keep take my blood sugars many times per day. My doctor would like to see them, but I am lazy and do not know how to get the many machines
I have to play nicely with my computer. So I will enter them into my website and give my doctor access. Just started this, needs some work but it is
fairly simple.

TODO
----
* Improve the blog interface
* Improve the blog editor feature
* Add some front end improvements
* Learn about database migrations
* Allow users to register
* Allow users to update their profiles
* Add a comments section for wedding pictures
