		This is my website. It is a work in progress. I am trying to accomplish a few things.
		First, I am trying to learn <a href='http://www.djangoproject.com'>Django</a>. Second,
		having recently been married, I am trying to get a way to distribute the pictures on the web
		so that only authenticated users can see them. Sure, there are easier ways to do this,
		but this seems like the perfect opportunity to learn something new. <br /><br />
		I have learned a lot so far, and have taken this opportunity to delve further into my
		favorite programming language, <a href='http://www.python.org'>Python</a>.
		Please check out the <a href="{% url 'basefunctions.views.about' %}">About</a> section
		to learn a little bit about me.
